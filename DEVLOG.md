# DEVLOG

## 2025-10-21 - Phase 0
- Completed Phase 0 scaffold: added README, workspace configuration files, module stubs, MIT license, and recorded initial commit.

## 2025-10-21 - Phase 1
- Built the HTML shell per DESIGN.md with single ESM entry, HUD, controls, and audio wiring; added baseline CSS for full-screen canvas and responsive overlays; verified clean load with styled UI and no console errors.

## 2025-10-21 - Phase 2
- Implemented the locked 11-track playlist module and boot-time select population from bundled assets; suppressed external file inputs and drag/drop so playback stays album-only.
