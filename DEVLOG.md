# DEVLOG

## 2025-10-21 - Phase 0
- Completed Phase 0 scaffold: added README, workspace configuration files, module stubs, MIT license, and recorded initial commit.

## 2025-10-21 - Phase 1
- Built the HTML shell per DESIGN.md with single ESM entry, HUD, controls, and audio wiring; added baseline CSS for full-screen canvas and responsive overlays; verified clean load with styled UI and no console errors.

## 2025-10-21 - Phase 2
- Implemented the locked 11-track playlist module and boot-time select population from bundled assets; suppressed external file inputs and drag/drop so playback stays album-only.

## 2025-10-21 - Phase 3
- Built the Web Audio graph with persistent volume control, analyser buffers, and slider binding so loudness ramps smoothly and survives reloads per Phase 3 acceptance.

## 2025-10-21 - Phase 4
- Implemented analyser feature extraction with band energy aggregates, RMS/centroid/roll-off/flatness metrics, signed deltas, EMAs, and spectral flux; exposed the sanitized 23-channel `getFeatureVector()` for downstream NN mapping and verified stable idle output.

## 2025-10-21 - Phase 5
- Shipped the tiny NN runtime with typed-array model loading, feature normalization, forward inference, and console self-test validation so downstream layers can run bounded predictions within the frame budget.

## 2025-10-21 - Phase 6
- Authored the 11 per-track placeholder models and wired `app.js` to load, cache, and warm up the matching model when the playlist changes; verified via DevTools that track switches swap models cleanly without new fetches.

## 2025-10-21 - Phase 7
- Implemented the mapping layer with critically-damped smoothing for the continuous channels, hysteretic gating for impulse-style responses, and safe-mode caps that keep photo-sensitive parameters within bounds; confirmed via DevTools console import that outputs stay stable at idle and respect the safety clamps.

## 2025-10-21 - Phase 8
- Built the physics core with pooled typed arrays, semi-implicit integration, gravity/noise/repel/spring forces, and adaptive caps tied to frame timing; verified in the running app via DevTools that the module imports cleanly and responds to parameter sweeps without errors, satisfying the Phase 8 acceptance.

## 2025-10-21 - Phase 9
- Delivered the canvas renderer with DPR-aware sizing, adaptive resolution scaling, trails, bloom compositing, and HUD bindings (volume readout plus safety toggles). Wired keyboard shortcuts and the physics rendering loop through `app.js`, then confirmed via Chrome DevTools on http://127.0.0.1:8000 that toggles/keys update visuals smoothly and the console stays clean aside from the expected favicon 404.
